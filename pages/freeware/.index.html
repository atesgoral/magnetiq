<p>This small program has proved very useful back in the times when most of us still had dial-up connections. It's still a very useful utility for setting up quick access to your POP3 mailbox when you're temporarily using someone else's computer. The fact that it doesn't require installation is a plus. You just download the zip file, extract the binary and run it, punch in your account settings and you're ready to go!</p>

<h3>Win-Res-Q</h3>

<p>Win-Res-Q (read "win rescue") is a simple utility that restores (shows) hidden windows. It can be used for bringing back your "lost" applications after their taskbar icons disappear following Explorer crashes that abundantly occur on Windows 98. It's also useful for exposing strange, hidden windows lurking around your desktop.</p>

<p>This was one of the first Windows applications that I had written using Delphi. I forgot exactly when I wrote it but the file date hints that it's around August 1998. Back then, I was still using the nickname "HeaT" and I also thought that splash screens were cool. When you launch the program, an annoying splash screen pops up with the name "HeaT" on it . It automatically goes away after a few seconds or as soon as you click on it. An installer is not available since it's only a single executable (and I was lazy).</p>

<p>You should be cautious when getting weird system windows shown since it might not be possible to re-hide them unless you restart Windows.</p>
